        Dear Hiring Manager, I'm excited to apply for the Full-Stack Developer 
        position . My experience with both the back-end and front-end stacks, as
        well as my proficiency in Java , HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be a
        great contribution to your team and company. I started as a self-taught
        WordPress Developer, I had the opportunity to work as the CTO for a
        Non-Profit startup The Kings & Queens Project. After a year with TKQP, I
        decided to expand my knowledge, I attend Robertson Collage to obtain my
        Full Stack Web Developer Diploma and graduated with honors. After
        graduation I was picked up by STEM Canada as a WordPress Developer
        Intern, & was recruited as a Jr Frontend React Developer by a startup
        call FutureCondos. While working with the FC team, I started developing
        from a WordPress Frontend developer, to a Full Stack Developer. Learning
        new frameworks, languages, implementing and deploying them with a sense
        of urgency. One of my strengths is i have a vast interest in Tech & Iâ€™m
        always looking at new ways on how i can add new tools, & methods.
        Recently I've graduated from Obisidi Academy Full Stack Bootcamp with
        98%.
